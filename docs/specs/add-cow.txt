== General ==

The raw file format does not support backing files or copy on write
feature. The add-cow image format makes it possible to use backing
files with an image by keeping a separate .add-cow metadata file.
Once all clusters have been written into the image it is safe to
discard the .add-cow and backing files, then we can use the image
directly.

An example usage of add-cow would look like:
(ubuntu.img is a disk image which has an installed OS.)
    1)  Create an image, such as raw format, with the same size of
        ubuntu.img:
            qemu-img create -f raw test.raw 8G
    2)  Create an add-cow image which will store dirty bitmap
            qemu-img create -f add-cow test.add-cow \
                -o backing_file=ubuntu.img,image_file=test.raw
    3)  Run qemu with add-cow image
            qemu -drive if=virtio,file=test.add-cow

test.raw may be larger than ubuntu.img, in that case, the size of
test.add-cow will be calculated from the size of test.raw.

image_fmt can be omitted, in that case image_fmt is assumed to be
"raw". backing_fmt can also be omitted, add-cow should do a probe
operation and determine what the backing file's format is. It is
recommended to always specify the format for any raw file, because
probing a raw file is a security hole.

The file format looks like this:

 +---------------+-------------------------------+
 |     Header    |           COW bitmap          |
 +---------------+-------------------------------+

All numbers in add-cow are stored in Little Endian byte order.

== Header ==

The Header is included in the first bytes:
(HEADER_SIZE is defined in 40-43 bytes.)
    Byte    0  -  3:    magic
                        add-cow magic string ("ACOW"). It is coded in
                        free-form ASCII.

            4  -  7:    backing file name offset
                        Offset in the add-cow file at which the backing
                        file name is stored (NB: The string is NOT
                        NUL-terminated).
                        If backing file name does NOT exist, this field
                        will be 0. Must be between 76 and [HEADER_SIZE
                        - 2](a file name must be at least 1 byte).

            8  - 11:    backing file name size
                        Length of the backing file name in bytes. It
                        will be 0 if the backing file name offset is
                        0. If backing file name offset is non-zero,
                        then it must be non-zero. Must be less than
                        [HEADER_SIZE - 76] to fit in the reserved
                        part of the header. Backing file name offset
                        + size must be no more than HEADER_SIZE.

            12 - 15:    image file name offset
                        Offset in the add-cow file at which the image
                        file name is stored (NB: The string is NOT
                        NUL-terminated). It must be between 76 and
                        [HEADER_SIZE - 2]. Image file name size + offset
                        must be no more than HEADER_SIZE.

            16 - 19:    image file name size
                        Length of the image file name in bytes.
                        Must be less than [HEADER_SIZE - 76] to fit in
                        the reserved part of the header.

            20 - 23:    cluster bits
                        Number of bits that are used for addressing an
                        offset within a cluster (1 << cluster_bits is
                        the cluster size). Must not be less than 12
                        (i.e. 4096 byte clusters).

                        Note: qemu as of today has an implementation
                        limit of 2 MB as the maximum cluster size and
                        won't be able to open images with larger cluster
                        sizes.

            24 - 31:    features
                        Bitmask of features. If a feature bit is set
                        but not recognized, the opening add-cow file must
                        fail.  No features bits are currently defined.

                        Bits 0-63:  Reserved (set to 0)

            32 - 39:    compatible features
                        Bitmask of compatible features. An implementation
                        can safely ignore any unknown bits that are set.
                        Bit 0:      All allocated bit.  If this bit is
                                    set then backing file and COW bitmap
                                    will not be used, and can read from
                                    or write to image file directly.

                        Bits 1-63:  Reserved (set to 0)

            40 - 43:    HEADER_SIZE
                        The header field is variable-sized. This field
                        indicates how many bytes will be used to store
                        add-cow header. By default, it is maximum value
                        of 4096 and cluster size value.

            44 - 59:    backing file format
                        Format of backing file. It will be filled with
                        0 if backing file name offset is 0. If backing
                        file name offset is non-empty, it must be
                        non-empty. It is coded in free-form ASCII, and
                        is NUL-terminated. Zero padded on the right. If
                        backing_fmt is omitted, must do a probe operation
                        and store the real format here.

            60 - 75:    image file format
                        Format of image file. It must be non-empty. It
                        is coded in free-form ASCII, and is
                        NUL-terminated. Zero padded on the right. If
                        image_fmt is omitted, "raw" will be stored
                        here.

            76 - [HEADER_SIZE - 1]:
                        It is used to make sure COW bitmap field starts
                        at the HEADER_SIZE byte, backing file name and
                        image file name will be stored here. The bytes
                        that are not pointing to backing file and image
                        file names must be set to 0.

== COW bitmap ==

The "COW bitmap" field starts at offset HEADER_SIZE, stores a bitmap
related to backing file and image file.  It is tracking whether the
cluster in image file is allocated or not.

Each bit in the bitmap tracks one cluster's status. For example, if
cluster bit is 16, then each bit tracks one cluster, (1 << 16) = 65536
bytes. The image file size is rounded up to cluster size (where any
bytes in the last cluster that do not fit in the image are ignored),
then if the number of clusters is not a multiple of 8, then remaining
bits in the bitmap will be set to 0.

The size of bitmap is calculated according to virtual size of image
file, and the size of bitmap should be multiple of add-cow file's
cluster size, the bits not used will be set to 0. Within each byte,
the least significant bit covers the first cluster. Bit orders in one
byte look like:
 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 | b7 | b6 | b5 | b4 | b3 | b2 | b1 | b0 |
 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

If the bit is 0, it indicates the cluster has not been allocated in
image file, data should be loaded from backing file while reading; if
the bit is 1, it indicates the related cluster has been dirty, should
be loaded from image file while reading. Writing to a cluster causes
the corresponding bit to be set to 1. If there is no backing file, or
if the image file is larger than the backing file and the offset is
beyond the end of the backing file, then the data should be read as
all zero bytes instead.

If image file is not an even multiple of cluster bytes, bits that
correspond to bytes beyond the image file size in add-cow must be written
as 0 and must be ignored when reading.

Image file name and backing file name must NOT be the same, we prevent
this while creating add-cow files via qemu-img. If image file name and
backing file name are the same, the add-cow image must be treated as
invalid.
